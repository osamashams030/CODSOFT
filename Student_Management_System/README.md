The Student Management System is a Java-based application that allows users to manage a collection of students. It includes features to add, remove, search for, and display student information. The system also incorporates a user-friendly interface and supports data persistence through methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a database.

Classes
1. Student Class
The Student class represents individual students and includes the following attributes:

Name
Roll Number
Grade
Other relevant details (add as needed)
2. StudentManagementSystem Class
The StudentManagementSystem class manages the collection of students and provides methods for various operations:

Add a student
Remove a student
Search for a student

User Interface
The user interface is designed to interact with the Student Management System. It can be implemented as a console-based interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX. The interface provides options such as:

Add a New Student: Allows users to input information for a new student and add them to the system.

Edit Student Information: Enables users to edit existing student information, ensuring data accuracy.

Search for a Student: Users can search for a specific student using criteria such as name, roll number, or grade.

Display All Students: Shows a list of all students in the system.

Exit Application: Allows users to gracefully exit the application.



Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
